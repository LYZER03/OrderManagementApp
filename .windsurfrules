## Important Design Principles
1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Role-based access control (AGENT/MANAGER roles)
   - Protected routes by user role
2. **Order Workflow Management**
   - Order status progression: CREATED → PREPARED → CONTROLLED → PACKED
   - Specialized interfaces for each workflow stage
   - Performance tracking for agents
3. **User Interface**
   - Material UI with Mantis Dashboard styling
   - Responsive design for various devices
   - Role-specific navigation and features
4. **Features**

   - Statistics dashboard with real-time KPIs
   - Agent performance tracking ("Table des Scores")
   - Automatic data refresh (60-second intervals for performance data)
5. **Data Management**
SQLite database (default)
RESTful API endpoints
Context API for frontend state management
